We take great pride in our dedication to using exclusively open data sources in our modeling efforts, which was a fundamental aspect of our approach during the challenge. While some proprietary data sources may have had greater predictive power, we firmly believed that utilizing open data sources was crucial to promoting the principles of transparency and reproducibility in our modeling efforts. By leveraging publicly available data, we were able to derive nowcasts of key economic indicators while ensuring that our work can be easily replicated and validated by others in the official statistics community. This approach not only provided us with a robust foundation for our models but also served to promote the values of open science, data transparency, and reproducibility.

During the challenge, we utilized three primary sources of data to inform our modeling efforts. The first source was **economic data** from the Eurostat database, which provided us with a comprehensive overview of the economic situation in the European Union. The second source of data was **financial data**, which provided us with valuable insights into the financial context surrounding each of the challenges. This data included stock prices, exchange rates, and other financial indicators that were useful in predicting economic trends and identifying potential risks. Finally, we also used **Google Trends** data to capture the most recent trends and shifts in consumer behavior. This data enabled us to monitor changes in search volume for specific keywords, which served as an early warning system for sudden changes in consumer sentiment and preferences. Overall, our use of these three distinct sources of data allowed us to develop a comprehensive understanding of the economic landscape and to generate nowcasts of the 3 target variables.

## Google Trends

Google Trends is a free online tool provided by Google that allows users to explore the popularity of search queries over time and across different regions and languages.
It provides valuable insights into the behavior of internet users, the topics they are interested in, and the evolution of search trends over time.

Nevertheless, the use of Google Trends data as a tool for economic analysis needs to be done carefully.
Google Trends provides Search Volume Indices (SVI) based on search ratios, with the initial search volume for a category or topic at a given time divided by the total number of searches at that date. 
However, changes in the denominator (total searches) can induce biases as internet use has evolved since 2004.

We implemented an approach to address this downward bias by extracting a common component from concurrent time series using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) on the log-SVI series long-term trends filtered out using an HP filter.
The rescaled first component obtained from the long-term log-SVIs is assumed to capture the common long-term trend, and it is subtracted from the log-SVIs.
This approach can help to remove the downward bias common to all Google Trends variables and improve their economic predictive power.
